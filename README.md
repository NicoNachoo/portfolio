## About Me

My name is **Nicol√°s Ignacio Torres L√≥pez**, and I am a passionate software developer from Valpara√≠so, Chile. With over 7 years of professional experience in software development, I specialize in web and API development, both on the frontend and backend, working with a variety of modern technologies and frameworks.

Throughout my career, I have contributed to diverse projects in reputable companies, gaining hands-on experience with tools like React, PHP (Laravel, Yii, Zend), Ruby on Rails, Docker, PostgreSQL, and more. My expertise extends to UX/UI design collaboration using Figma and efficient task management through platforms like Jira, Trello, and Shortcut.

As a professional, I am recognized for my honesty, responsibility, and eagerness to learn. My straightforward communication and motivation to solve challenges have helped me deliver impactful solutions that meet user and business needs.

I hold a Computer Science degree from Universidad T√©cnica Federico Santa Mar√≠a and have also served as a Teaching Assistant in software development and programming languages courses.

I am fluent in Spanish (native) and proficient in English (B2 level), enabling me to collaborate effectively in diverse, international teams.

In my spare time, I enjoy activities that challenge me both physically and mentally, like handball, where I was the college team goalkeeper for four years. My academic thesis focused on educational psychology, which highlights my interest in leveraging technology for learning and development.
